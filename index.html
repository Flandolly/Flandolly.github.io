                Hi! I'm Christina. It's very nice to meet you!
                I'm 23 years old, born and raised in the lovely state of New York.

                My adventure to become a coder is a little unique, as it actually first began at a
                pretty young age! My first coding experience dates all the way back to middle school during
                a one-week mini coding bootcamp making games with Alice (and Java). I didn't realize it
                at the time, but this experience would stick with me for the rest of my school days
                as my passion and curiosity for computer science and programming would grow!

                After obtaining my associate's degree in computer science, I had set my heart on completing
                my bachelor's degree as well and jumping headfirst into the job market. However, as I
                was starting my first semester at a new school in January 2020, COVID-19 hit my state, and I
                was forced to return home. I found a non-tech job to make ends meet and things were okay
                for a while, but I felt unchallenged and wanted a more fulfilling career in the field I had come
                to love for the past decade. So, I made the big decision to enroll full time into a coding
                bootcamp to learn software engineering.

                Just like that, I realized why I loved programming so much. I simply loved to grow.
                I still had the curiosity and excitement to learn of my childhood. I liked reading up
                on documentation to figure out how things worked. I liked experimenting with different
                libraries and expanding on things I previously only had elementary knowledge about if
                it meant providing a better experience for the prospective users. I strove to always
                put 110% into my projects and demonstrate that all my work is designed to please the user.
